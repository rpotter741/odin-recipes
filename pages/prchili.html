        <h1> Do You Like It Hot?</h1>
        <p>Because if you do, this is a scalable recipe for heat!</p>
        <p>In truth, what makes this chili so divine is it's use of [redacted], which
            creates a wonderful balance between [redacted] and [redacted]. </p>
        <!--You really thought I would put my chili recipe on Github for anyone to see? It's won cookoffs in three states and in South Korea!-->
        You'll need the following ingredients:
        <ul>
            <li>1 can of black beans</li>
            <li>1 can of dark red kidney beans</li>
            <li>1 can of pinto beans</li>
            <li>1 pound of ground beef (I prefer 85/15, but any will do)</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 [redacted]</li>
            <li>1 [redacted]</li>
            <li>1 [redacted]</li>
            <li>2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Isn't it nice that my 'website' gets straight to the nitty-gritty instead of bombarding you
            with a boat-load of personal information? Anyway...</p>
        As this is a proof-of-concept rather than an actual repository for recipes, I'll stop here.
